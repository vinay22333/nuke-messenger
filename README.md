Facebook Message Deleter

IMPORTANT: This script is working as of 8th May 2023. 

This is a simple JavaScript script that can be used to delete Facebook messages one by one. The script uses the Facebook web interface and the browser's developer console to automate the deletion process.

To use the script, simply copy and paste it into the browser's developer console while on the Facebook website. The script will then simulate a click on the "Delete Chat" button for each message, deleting them one by one.

Please note that this script is provided as-is and comes with no warranty or guarantee of any kind. Use it at your own risk.

Contributions and feedback are welcome!

Note: If it fails to delete, update the div and span selectors accordingly.
